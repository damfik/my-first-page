         <p>The Hardangerfjord is the third longest fjord in the world, and the second longest fjord in Norway. 
  It is located in Hordaland county in the Hardanger region. The fjord stretches 179 kilometres (111 mi) from the Atlantic Ocean into the mountainous interior of Norway along the Hardangervidda plateau.
  The innermost point of the fjord reaches the town of Odda.</p>

  The traditions, intriguing food and endless history immediately had me wrapped up in a time warp. Plus, you can ride on the Hogwarts Express. YES, you read correct. The real Hogwarts Express.</p>
